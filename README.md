# UltimateStalker
The Ultimate Stalker helps you Download images from Instagram public repositories.


# How it Works?

### Scrape URL
Given a handle, you can download the images that appear on the first 12 tiles of the page. The instagram layout is a 3x4 layout and once you scroll down it requests for more 12 images. This is a typical example of [Lazy Loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading).
